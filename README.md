# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
Stock price data of Britannia Industries Predicted <br> <br>
Stock Price Prediction using machine learning helps you discover the future value of company stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. Predicting how the stock market will perform is a hard task to do. There are other factors involved in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behavior, and so on. All these factors combine to make share prices dynamic and volatile. This makes it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy. <br>
This project aims to use Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM), a variant of RNNs, for building the model to predict stock price of Britannia Industries. <br>
The reason for using LSTM, instead of other prediction models like Linear Regression, SVM, RNNs, etc, is that LSTM has the ability to learn long_term dependencies. <br>
The project's performance is measured using root mean square(RMSE) evaluation metric. <br>
